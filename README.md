# Arti DAO
 
This DAO has been created in the context of our Solidity class as part of Homework 5.
 
 
## What is the DAO about
 
Arti DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on curating and showcasing art pieces in a virtual art gallery. It allows members to propose new artworks and update a virtual gallery through on-chain governance. Members can delegate their voting power, vote on proposals, and exit the DAO entirely by rage quitting, burning their tokens and resetting their governance status.
 

### Tools and Frameworks Used
 
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development
 
- **Foundry**: Testing and deployment
 
- **OpenZeppelin**: ERC20 contracts and standard utilities
 
- **Hardhat**: Optional for local testing
 

 
### Smart Contracts
 
1. **ArtGalleryToken**: An ERC20 token contract allowing delegation, voting, and rage quitting. Users can delegate their voting power, vote on proposals, and rage quit to burn their tokens and reset their status.
 
2. **Gallery**: Manages the creation of proposals and voting logic. Tracks proposals and their execution status based on community votes.

 
## Requirements to Run Locally (NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART YET)
 
1. **Dependencies**:
 
   - Node.js (â‰¥ 18.x)
 
   - Foundry (Install via `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`)
     ```plaintext
     - forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit
     - forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
     ```
   - Alchemy or Infura API key for Sepolia testnet deployments

 
2. **Environment Setup**:
 
Create a `.env` file with the following:
 
```plaintext
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
 
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your-sepolia-rpc-url
```
 
3. **Run the following command** : 
 
```plaintext
forge build
 
forge test
```
 

## Usage Example -- check these

1. **Deploy the contracts**

Using the Deploy.s.col script, deploy the `ArtGalleryToken` contract first to create the ArtGalleryToken (AGT) token, and then the `Gallery` contract, passing in the address of the deployed `ArtGalleryToken`.

```plaintext
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

2. **Mint, Delegate, and Approve tokens**

Call `mint(address,uint256), delegate(address), and approve(address,uint256)` on the `ArtGalleryToken` contract.

```plaintext
cast send $ADDRESS(ArtGalleryToken) "mint(address,uint256)" $YOUR_ADDRESS $TOKEN_AMOUNT --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

cast send $ADDRESS(ArtGalleryToken) "delegate(address)" $YOUR_ADDRESS --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

cast send $ADDRESS(ArtGalleryToken) "approve(address,uint256)" $ADDRESS(Gallery) $TOKEN_AMOUNT --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
   
4. **Create a Proposal**

Call `createProposal(string calldata description)` on the `Gallery` contract.

```plaintext
cast send $ADDRESS(Gallery) "createProposal(string,bytes,uint8)" "$NAME" $CALLDATA $TYPE
```

5. **Vote on Proposals**

Call `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)` on the `Gallery` contract to vote.

```plaintext
cast send $ADDRESS(Gallery) "castVoteQuadratic(uint256,bool,uint256)" $PROPOSAL_ID $VOTE $TOKEN_AMOUNT --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key 
```

6. **Execute Approved Proposals**

Once voting is completed and a proposal has passed, it can be finalised by the owner, the execution confirmed by at least 2 of the signers, and then executed.

```plaintext
cast send $ADDRESS(Gallery) "finalizeProposal(uint256)" $PROPOSAL_ID --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key 

cast send $ADDRESS(Gallery) "confirmProposalExecution(uint256)" $PROPOSAL_ID --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key 

cast send $ADDRESS(Gallery) "executeProposal(uint256)" $PROPOSAL_ID --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key 
```
